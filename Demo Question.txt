1. What are the essential concepts to understand in wrapper classes? 

    Answer: The most significant concepts to understand in wrapper classes are the eight primitive types of wrapper 
    classes and where they are best used. It is important to note that it is final and immutable once a wrapper class is assigned. 


Q2.Let’s talk about serialization and deserialization a little.

    Answer: Sure! Serialization and deserialization are data handling concepts related to stream handling in Java. Serializing an object means converting it to a byte stream to save or relocate it to another device. Deserializing is the process of undoing the serialization process.


Q3: What is a final class in Java?
    This is a designation that says a class cannot be extended or overridden by a subclass. Declaring a class final helps prevent inheritance and keeps information secure.

Q4.What does static mean? 
    When you declare a variable or a method as static, it belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects
